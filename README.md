# DRRRT-motion-planning

This repository contains a custom simulator written to analyze the
effectiveness of "Dynamic Region-biased Rapidly-exploring Random Trees" in
robotic motion planning applications (compared to "standard" RRT).

A brief presentation on the DRRRT strategy can be viewed
[here](presentation/slides.pdf).

A more comprehensive report can be read [here](report/report.pdf).

More information on the implementation itself can be found in the
[DRRRT README](DRRRT/README.md).
